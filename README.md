# SE to ML Journey

This repository documents my learning path as I transition from Software Engineering (SE) to Machine Learning (ML). Here, I will showcase different projects, Jupyter notebooks, and datasets I use to explore the fundamentals of machine learning and data science. The goal is to build a solid foundation in ML concepts while leveraging my background in SE.

## Repository Structure

- **basic_ML.ipynb**: A basic introduction to machine learning concepts and algorithms.
- **matplotlib.ipynb**: Visualizations using Matplotlib to help understand data.
- **numpy.ipynb**: Introduction to NumPy for efficient mathematical and array operations.
- **pandas.ipynb**: Data manipulation and analysis using Pandas.
- **output.csv**: Example dataset for experimenting with the basic ML algorithms.
- **ml/**: Contains ML-related projects.
    - **linear_regression/**: Basic Linear Regression notebooks and dataset.
        - **basic_lr1.ipynb**: Simple linear regression implementation.
        - **basic_lr2.ipynb**: Another linear regression notebook with a different approach.
        - **USA_Housing.csv**: Dataset for performing linear regression tasks on housing prices.
    - **logistic_regression/**: Logistic Regression notebooks for classification tasks.
        - **basic_lr1.ipynb**: Introduction to logistic regression.
        - **train.csv**: Example dataset for training logistic regression models.
