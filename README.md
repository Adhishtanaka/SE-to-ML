# SE to ML Journey

This repository documents my learning path as I transition from Software Engineering (SE) to Machine Learning (ML). Here, I will showcase different projects, Jupyter notebooks, and datasets I use to explore the fundamentals of machine learning and data science. The goal is to build a solid foundation in ML concepts while leveraging my background in SE.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adhishtanaka/SE-to-ML.git
   cd se-to-ml
   jupyter notebook
   ```
